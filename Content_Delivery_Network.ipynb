    "* Push\n",
    "  + CDN is updated whenever you upload files to your server\n",
    "  + you control the process\n",
    "  + good if you don't have much static content\n",
    "  + very expensive if you have a million images\n",

    "* Pull\n",
    "  + lazy load. Only when a user requests a content that is not cached, CND servers will go to your server, download the content and cache it\n",
    "  + If you are the first user requesting an image, it will be slow, but fast for the folloiwng users\n",
