    "  + Understand the problem statement correctly and underline the key points\n",
    "  + discuss the trade-offs with the interviewer and play to your strengths\n",
    "  + optimize code using better data structures according to the situation\n",
    "  + insights into problem extension, and making initial code design accordingly\n",
    "* Design your code more elegantly, using industry best practices\n",
    "  + design class diagram from problem statement\n",
    "  + key role in writing test cases, including edge cases, though need not be very edgy\n",
    "* Key results\n",
    "  + able to address the entire problem statement through the initial class diagram\n",
    "    + while during the process of implementing it by code, new elements will be added and update the initial class diagram to the final class diagram\n",
    "  + decision to expose only desired APIs\n",
    "    + only expose public class necessary \n",
    "    + decide and design the APIs of public class to meet the objectives\n",
    "    + APIs open as needed to reduce the security risks for the application\n",
    "    + insights into the data required for achieving the requirements\n",
    "    + necessary modifications to the APIs for code sustainability (discuss wit interveiwers for APIs given but not sufficient for completing the given requirements, or redundant APIs)\n",
    "  + Address the statement using minimalistic requirements\n",
    "    + encapsulation and generating only the required access mutators\n",
    "    \n",
    "  + sort out the priorities  \n",
    "    + identify the key requirements and addressing them in priority (core and bonus requirements)\n",
    "    + almost any program/code can be optimized further. Know when to stop\n",
    "    + time management. Check pressure points in case execution fails in due time\n",
    "      + the code should be clean, modular and extensible\n",
    "      + have a fall-back plan in case your code doesn't work   "
