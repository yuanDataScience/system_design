    "## Load Balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "* Load balancer is a machine that runs a reverse proxy software\n",
    "* The goal is to distribute the requests between multiple servers that host the actual application\n",
    "* Users don't realize the server behind\n",
    "* Thousands of clients can issue requests to  servers, load balancers can be between clients and servers to evenly distribute load between servers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Round robin\n",
    "* go through all the server to distribute work loads\n",
    "* Work loads are evenly distributed\n",
    "* Avoid overloading one server\n",
    "* Not efficient if servers have different capacities and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance and resource based load balance\n",
    "* load balancer performs health checks on \n",
    "  + how much traffic a server is handling at any time\n",
    "  + How long a server is taking to respond to traffic\n",
    "  + How many resources a server is using\n",
    "* Load balancer distributes work loads based on the health check results\n",
    "* Load balancer stops passing requests to low performance or broken servers \n",
    "* It evens the loads between servers with better throughput and  latency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Path based server selection strategy\n",
    "* distributes requests according to the path of the requests\n",
    "* distribute request to different servers according to the path the requests go\n",
    "  + Payment requests are sent to payment servers\n",
    "  + Post requests are sent to post servers\n",
    "* If code of specific functions needs updates, other functions are not affected\n",
    "* If servers of specific functions are broken, other functions are not affected\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted round robin\n",
    "* Distribute work loads according to the resources/capacity of servers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random\n",
    "* If one  server is overloaded by chance so it can create problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of load balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layer 4 \n",
    "* transport layer\n",
    "* has access to TCP r UDP using IP port\n",
    "* maintain session/connection using session stickiness by assigning an id attribute to a user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layer 7\n",
    "* application layer\n",
    "* has access to layer 4 and HTTP headers, cookies and payload\n",
    "* more complex than layer 4 Load balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to place load balancers\n",
    "* Between clients and servers\n",
    "* Between servers and databases\n",
    "* At DNS layer where IP resolving happens\n",
    "  + Multiple servers deployed, each assigned a unique IP\n",
    "  + Load balancer is between servers and requests\n",
    "  + Load balancer resolves IP and balance the requests to servers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* make systems more resilient by monitoring and detecting severs and stop sending requests to unhealthy servers to imporve availability\n",
    "* improve the scalability of the system by horizonal scaling\n",
    "* imporve the peformance by distributing requests to severs with less load, and thus avoid overloading and network congestion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other key services of load balancer\n",
    "* health checking: use heartbeat protocol to check healthy and reliability of servers\n",
    "* TLS termination: decreases the burden of end servers by handling TLS termination with clients. \n",
    "  + load balancers will decrypt the code and forward it to end servers and reduce the decryption workload for end servers\n",
    "  + AWS NLB also has the TLS termination function\n",
    "* predictive analytics: predict traffic patterns through analytics over traffic through them\n",
    "* decrease human intervention by decreasing system administration required in handling failures\n",
    "* service discovery: forward client's requests to appropriate hosting server by inquiring serviced registry\n",
    "* security: mitigate DDOS at different OSI model (Layers 3, 4 and 7)\n"
