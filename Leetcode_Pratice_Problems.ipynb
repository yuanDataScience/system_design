    "### Design Log Aggregation System\n",
    "* overview\n",
    "  + Design the LogAggregator class:\n",
    "    + LogAggregator(int machines, int services) Initializes the object with machines and services representing the number of machines and services in the datacenter, respectively.\n",
    "    + void pushLog(int logId, int machineId, int serviceId, String message) Adds a log with id logId notifying that the machine machineId sent a string message while executing the service serviceId.\n",
    "    + List\\<Integer\\> getLogsFromMachine(int machineId) Returns a list of ids of all logs added by machine machineId.\n",
    "    + List\\<Integer\\> getLogsOfService(int serviceId) Returns a list of ids of all logs added while running service serviceId on any machine.\n",
    "    + List\\<String\\> search(int serviceId, String searchString) Returns a list of messages of all logs added while running service serviceId where the message of the log contains searchString as a substring.  \n",
    "  + Note that:\n",
    "    + The entries in each list should be in the order they were added, i.e., the older logs should precede the newer logs.\n",
    "    + A machine can run multiple services more than once. Similarly, a service can be run on multiple machines.\n",
    "    + All logId may not be ordered.\n",
    "    + A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.   \n",
    "* algorithm\n",
    "  + First, we need to have an ordered data structure for both machine list and service list\n",
    "    + getLogsFromMachine and getLogsOfService both return an ordered list of all the log ids\n",
    "  + search function returns a list of message in logs that contains the searchString as a substring\n",
    "  + based on the above two requirements, we can set two lists, one for each machine id, the second for each service id to store the log ids added to each of the list when pushLog function is executed\n",
    "  + to store the log messages, we use a dictionary from log id to log message. When search function is executed, we first fetch a list of log id, and then check for each log id, if its message contains the searchString\n",
    "  \n",
    "* solution\n",
    "  + in the given solution from Leetcode, instead of using lists to store the mapping from service and machine ids to log ids, the solutoin used defaultdict, which is basically the same as the lists we used here since the element index is used as the key to the dictionary. Notice that we have a fixed number of machines and services, and therefore, each service and machine id are guaranteed to be within the index ranges of the lists\n",
    "  + In addition, in search function, accssing to each service item by list index is also O(1), the same as default dict."

    "  + Implement the WhatsApp class:\n",
    "    + hatsApp() Initializes the object.\n",
    "    + oid sendMessage(int toUser, String message) Sends a personal message with the text message to the user with id: toUser.\n",
    "    + nt createGroup(int[] initialUsers) Creates a new group that initially contains users whose ids are in the list initialUsers, and the group id is returned. For each group created, increment the ids sequentially. For the first group to be created id = 1, for the second group id = 2, and so on.\n",
    "    + oid addUserToGroup(int groupId, int userId) Adds the user with id: userId to the group with id: groupId. This call should be ignored if the user is already in that group, or if the group does not exist.\n",
    "    + oid sendGroupMessage(int fromUser, int groupId, String message) Sends a message with the text message by the user with id: fromUser to the group with id: groupId. The message should be sent to all members of the group except the sender. Users added afterwards to the group should not receive the message. Also, this call should be ignored if the user is not a part of the group, or if the group does not exist.\n",
    "    + List\\<String\\> getMessagesForUser(int userId) Returns all the personal and group messages that were sent to the user with id: userId ordered by the latest ones first.\n",

    "* Algorithm\n",
    "  + we need the direct access to users from application, and from groups\n",
    "    + to do this, we create two dictionaries, one for users, another for groups in application\n",
    "    + we can directly access users, or access users from groups\n",
    "    + when add a user to a group, we create a user, and then add the user to the group, and add the mapping of the user in users dictionary.\n",
    "    + since both the group and application contain users dictionary, we can easy check access the user from both app and groups. Both of the dictionaries refer to the same object reference.\n",
    "  + since the meassges need to be retrieved as list from the most recent to earlier, we use a deque and use its appendleft() function to insert messages to the top of the queue  \n",
    "* Offical algorithm and version 2 \n",
    "  + we actually only need to maintain two defaultdict. \n",
    "    + One for groups with group id and the corresponding user ids as a set. \n",
    "    + one for users with user id and a list to save the messages\n",
    "    + we use defaultdict so that we don't need to check the edge cases of\n",
    "      + creating new users and adding messages or adding messages to an existing user.\n",
    "      + creating a group and then adding users or adding users to an existing group \n",
    "      + The defaultdict will automaitcally create the list or set for us\n",
    "    + we use a set in each group entry to manage the users so that we don't need to consider a user added to a group repeatedly  "
